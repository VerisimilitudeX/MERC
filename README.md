The Multi-modal Epigenetic Research and Computation (MERC) Framework aims to develop a SOTA method for imputing missing epigenetic data by integrating multiple machine learning techniques and training on multi-omics data. This novel approach will combine M2-BERT (newest version of BERT), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), explainable AI (XAI probably with L1 regularization feature selection/importance), self-attention mechanisms, and dynamic structural equation modeling to improve upon the accuracy of current models (**<— technological novelty factor**). It is relevant in the context of epigenetic age acceleration genes and diseases (**<— direct impact factor/story**).

2. Specific Goals

1. Research topic: Develop a multi-modal framework that is trained on DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and other epigenetic data in order to impute missing values in epigenetic data.
2. Improve imputation accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods (see links to existing solutions below), particularly for DNA methylation and histone modification data.
3. Use XAI to improve interpretability
4. Validate the framework on epigenetic age acceleration and related disease DBs.
5. Create a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data sharing platform to facilitate collaboration in epigenetics research (ISEF winner emphasized this specifically).
6. Create a GUI so it is user accessible, make it so that any research or user can use it easily
